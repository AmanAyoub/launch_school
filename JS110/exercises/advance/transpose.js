A 3x3 matrix can be represented by an array of arrays: an outer array containing three subarrays
that each contain three elements. For example, the 3x3 matrix shown below:


1  5  8
4  7  2
3  9  6
is represented by the following array of arrays:


let matrix = [
  [1, 5, 8],
  [4, 7, 2],
  [3, 9, 6],
];
An array of arrays is sometimes called a "nested array" because each inner subarray is nested inside an outer array.
It also may be called a "two-dimensional array"

To access an element in the matrix, you can use bracket notation twice (such as array[][]),
and include both the row index and column index within the brackets. Given the above matrix,
matrix[0][2] is 8, and matrix[2][1] is 9. An entire row in the matrix can be referenced using a single index:
matrix[1] is the row (subarray) [4, 7, 2]. Furthermore, given a row, we can determine the total number of
columns by counting the number of elements in the row. Unfortunately, a convenient notation for accessing
an entire column does not exist.

The transpose of a 3x3 matrix is the matrix that results from exchanging the rows and columns of the original matrix.
For example, the transposition of the matrix shown above is:


1  4  3
5  7  9
8  2  6
Write a function that takes an array of arrays that represents a 3x3 matrix and returns the transpose of the matrix.
You should implement the function on your own, without using any external libraries.

Take care not to modify the original matrix â€” your function must produce a new matrix and leave the input
matrix array unchanged.

In: array (2D)
Out: array (a new 2D array)
Rules:
 - Do not mutate the input array
 - Exchange the rows and columns


1. Create an empty array `matrix`
2. Extract the three rows from the input array
3. Iterate through the rows
 - Get the current elements of each row
 - Store the elements in an array
 - Append the array to `matrix`
4. Return the `matrix` array

function transpose(array) {
  let matrix = [];
  let [ first, second, third ] = array;
  for (let idx = 0; idx < first.length; idx++) {
    matrix.push([first[idx], second[idx], third[idx]]);
  }

  return matrix;
}
const matrix = [
  [1, 5, 8],
  [4, 7, 2],
  [3, 9, 6]
];

let newMatrix = transpose(matrix);

console.log(newMatrix);      // [[1, 4, 3], [5, 7, 9], [8, 2, 6]]
console.log(matrix);         // [[1, 5, 8], [4, 7, 2], [3, 9, 6]]

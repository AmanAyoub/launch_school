Stack Machine Interpretation

A stack is a list of values that grows and shrinks dynamically. A stack may be implemented as
an Array that uses two Array methods: Array.prototype.push and Array.prototype.pop.

A stack-and-register programming language is a language that uses a stack of values. Each
operation in the language operates on a register, which can be thought of as the current
value. The register is not part of the stack. An operation that requires two values pops the
topmost item from the stack (i.e., the operation removes the most recently pushed value from
the stack), operates on the popped value and the register value, and stores the result back in
the register.

This sounds complex, but the behavior is straightforward and easy to walk through manually.
Consider a MULT operation in a stack-and-register language. It removes the value from the
stack, multiplies the removed stack value with the register value, then stores the result back
in the register. For example, if we start with a stack of [3, 6, 4] (where 4 is the topmost
item in the stack) and a register value of 7, the MULT operation mutates the stack to [3, 6]
(the 4 is removed), and the result of the multiplication, 28, is left in the register. If we
do another MULT at this point, the stack is mutated to [3], and the register is left with the
value 168.

Write a function that implements a miniature stack-and-register-based programming language
that has the following commands (also called operations or tokens):

n : Place a value, n, in the register. Do not modify the stack.

PUSH : Push the register value onto the stack. Leave the value in the register.

ADD : Pop a value from the stack and add it to the register value, storing the result in the
register.

SUB : Pop a value from the stack and subtract it from the register value, storing the result in
the register.

MULT : Pop a value from the stack and multiply it by the register value, storing the result in
the register.

DIV : Pop a value from the stack and divide the register value by the popped stack value,
storing the integer result back in the register.

REMAINDER : Pop a value from the stack and divide the register value by the popped stack value,
storing the integer remainder of the division back in the register.

POP : Remove the topmost item from the stack and place it in the register.

PRINT : Print the register value.

All operations are integer operations (which is only important with DIV and REMAINDER).

Programs will be supplied to your language function via a string argument. Your function may
assume that all arguments are valid programs â€” i.e., they will not do anything like trying to
pop a non-existent value from the stack, and they won't contain any unknown tokens.

Initialize the stack and register to the values [] and 0, respectively.

input:
- string

output:
- number

rules:
- stack: an array of integers / values
- register: an integer value 
- decimal values should be converted to integers
- input will always be known / valid commands

ds:
- array: to store values in the stack
- object: to create / store tokens or commands

algo:
- initialize 'register' to 0
- initialize 'stack' to an empty array
- create 'commands' object
  - print 'register'
  - push the value from 'register' to the 'stack'
  - get a value from the 'stack' and add it to the 'register' value. store the result back in 'register'
  - get a value from the 'stack' and substract it from the 'register' value. store the result back in 'register'
  - get a value from the 'stack' and multiply it to the 'register' value. store the result back in 'register'
  - get a value from the 'stack' and divide it by the 'register' value. store the result back in 'register'
  - get a value from the 'stack' and get it's remainder from the 'register' value. store the result back in 'register'
  - get a value from the 'stack', and store it in the 'register'
- convert the input string into an array of words
- loop through the array;
  - if the current element is a number
    - store it in the 'register' 
  - otherwise, if current element is equal to the current property in 'commands'
    - invoke the associated method

Further Exploration:

Refactor the minilang function to include some error handling. In particular, the function
should detect and report empty stack conditions (trying to use a value from the stack when
there are no values), and invalid tokens in the program. Ideally, the function should return
an error message if an error occurs, or undefined if the program runs successfully.

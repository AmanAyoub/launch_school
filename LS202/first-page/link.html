      The Creating Hyperlinks section of
      <a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/getting-to-know-html/#creating-hyperlinks" target="_blank">Getting to Know HTML</a>
      discusses hyperlinks, or anchors. Be sure to work both "In Practice" sections; they
      pick up from where you left off in an earlier reading assignment.
